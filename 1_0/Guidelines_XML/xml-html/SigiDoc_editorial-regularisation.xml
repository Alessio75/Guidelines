                <p>Regularised spellings of irregular forms, such as dialect forms, late spellings, phonetic spellings, etc. (see also the previous).</p>
                <p>These tags are intended to make a distinction between the scribal errors (for which see the previous entry)
                    and text normalized or regularized from a dialect or phonetic spelling, grammatical form, etc.,
                    which can not be considered errors strictly speaking. However, because there is not a Leiden symbol for this kind of regularisations,
                    the output of this tagging after transformation is the same as the previous.</p>
                <p>Alternative: leaving the original version in the edition and adding the correction in the external apparatus criticus (<ref target="SigiDoc_supp-apparatuscriticus.html">see</ref>).</p>
