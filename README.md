# SigiDoc Guidelines - The code of the previous versions
 
These are the outdated guidelines of SigiDoc, in their version 1.0 and 1.1, formerly stored on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/sigidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/guidelines/) (destined to be no longer used) and published at [https://sigidoc.huma-num.fr/](https://sigidoc.huma-num.fr/Guidelines_XML/xml-html/SigiDoc_allguidelines.html) (site that will soon no longer be the place where guidelines are published).

These guidelines are currently being updated to the 2.0 version in the framework of the DFG-ANR project DigiByzSeal "Unlocking the Hidden Value of Seals: New Methodologies for Historical Research in Byzantine Studies" ANR: https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-FRAL-0008; DFG: https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/469385434.
They are currently a work in progress and are available as [Wiki](https://github.com/SigiDoc/Guidelines/wiki) in this same repository.
