# SigiDoc Guidelines
 
These are the guidelines of SigiDoc 1.0, an encoding standard - clean subset of EpiDoc - for the scholarly edition of Byzantine lead seals and coin-like objects.

These guidelines are currently being updated to the 1.1 version in the framework of the DFG-ANR project DigiByzSeal "Unlocking the Hidden Value of Seals: New Methodologies for Historical Research in Byzantine Studies" ANR: https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-21-FRAL-0008; DFG: https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/469385434.
They are a work in progress.
