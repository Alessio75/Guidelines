                    <placeName type="" ref="">[name here]</placeName>
                </egXML>
                <p>Because multiple tagging is possible, it could be used in different but complementary ways, ex. for the cities:</p>
                    <p>• to depict the typology of a place: <att>type</att>="city"</p>
                    <p>• to depict the function for which the name is used on the seal: <att>type</att>="bishopric"</p>
                    <p>Ethnonyms should be tagged as place names: e.g. in "bishop of the Nikopolitôn", "Nikopolitôn" should be indexed as Nikopolis.</p>
                <p>2. Physical features (rivers, mountains, etc.):</p>

                <p>• Designed for the actual place + reference to the authority list.</p>
                    <p>• The <att>type</att> attribute could be used to specify what kind of place/feature is: city, theme, diocesis, church, etc., and it can also be used to identify ethnic names as opposed to the place names themselves.</p>
                    <p>• The spelling should be normalised in the authority list.</p>
