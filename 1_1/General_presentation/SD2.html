   <h2>Some history</h2>
   <p>SigiDoc represents the extension of the digital approach, already applied to inscriptions,
    coins, and papyri, to Byzantine seals. In the early years, the main aim was to store and analyse
    data; but in 2006, at the time of the Byzantine Congress in <a
     href="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/project/calendar/sigidoc.html" target="_blank">London</a>, a
    group of sigillographers met to consider the possible next step, a way of publishing seals,
    using XML markup, which could incorporate the functions of a database. Talks continued in 2010
    and 2011 at King's College London, Dumbarton Oaks, and during the Byzantine Congress held in
    Sofia (a record of some of those previous discussions is still available in a <a
     href="http://sigidoc.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">Wiki</a>, which, however, has not been
    updated since 2011). The intention was to build on the markup protocols which had been created
    for inscriptions (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/" target="_blank"
     >EpiDoc</a>) which were then developed for papyri (<a href="http://papyri.info/"
     target="_blank">Papyri.info</a>), and later modified for the publication of coins (<a
     href="http://nomisma.org/" target="_blank">Nomisma</a>). Professor Charlotte Roueché and her
    colleagues were using EpiDoc for inscriptions, and she and Professor Jean-Claude Cheynet
    attempted to get funding to extend the work to seals; but this was only successful in 2015, in
    the framework of a Marie Curie fellowship at King's College London (<a
     href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/195119/factsheet/en" target="_blank">Digiseal</a>),
    where Dr Alessio Sopracasa worked under the supervision of Prof. Roueché and Dr. Gabriel Bodard,
    one of the main architects of EpiDoc, and SigiDoc entered in a second - and very different -
    phase of its development.</p>
   <p>More recently, notably thanks to the interest showed by Prof. Claudia Sode (Cologne
    University), a small but determined team has been created around Dr Sopracasa, including,
    besides Prof. Sode, Dr Vivien Prigent (from the CNRS) and Martina Filosa (from Cologne
    University), and with the technical assistance of several digital humanists.</p>
   <p>SigiDoc went public for the first time in May 2019: it was presented to the international
    community of Byzantine sigillographers during the <a href="http://bit.ly/3ESb2jA"
     target="_blank">12th International Symposium of Byzantine Sigillography</a> held at the
    Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.</p>
   <h2>SigiDoc's genealogy</h2>
   <p>SigiDoc is largely based on the experience of EpiDoc, the set of recommendations for
    epigraphic material, and on solutions such as Nomisma, adopted for the digital edition of coins,
    since coins are the physical objects most similar to seals. EpiDoc gave to SigiDoc experience
    and solutions for the description and the analysis of seals' legends and metadata (physical
    description, history, dating, etc.), but this body of experience has been adapted, selected, and
    enhanced in order to make it suitable for SigiDoc, which builds on the experience already gained
    in other fields to develop a set of tools specifically designed for sigillographers.</p>

    <figcaption>1.1. Origins and (possible) spreading of SigiDoc.</figcaption></figure>
   <p>In the last few years, <a href="https://github.com/EpiDoc/EFES/wiki" target="_blank">EFES</a>
    (EpiDoc Front-End Services), a customisable platform for the online publication of ancient texts
    in EpiDoc, has been developed. SigiDoc has become one of the projects using and testing EFES
    and, in this way, contributing to its development: at present SigiDoc is the only non-epigraphic
    project working with EFES. Thanks to this platform it is possible to get immediately a raw
    version of the future web page (without the elegant webdesign): for non expert users, it can be
    very frustrating to work on XML without having an idea of the final output. Besides that, EFES
    provides two other crucial features, the creation of <b>dynamic indices</b> and a <b>search
     interface</b>.</p>
   <p>With SigiDoc sigillographers have at their disposal a <b>standard for the digital edition of
     seals</b>, that is, seals directly edited in a digital environment, which can then be published
    either online or on paper. This should therefore facilitate the creation of corpora: of course,
    a single huge corpus of potentially all Byzantine seals is imaginable, and SigiDoc might offer
    the possibility to create it, with time, people, and money. But the use of SigiDoc as a common
    and shared tool will allow the creation of several collections or corpora large or small: this
    means that anyone will be able to conceive and manage their own project, in a totally
    independent way, with the advantage that all the projects based on SigiDoc will be virtually
    unified by the use of this standard, because their content could be searchable through a common
    search interface. In addition, SigiDoc is by nature multilingual: the use of English as one of
    the languages of the corpus is of course recommended, but not compulsory.</p>
   <h2>From the seal to the webpage</h2>
   <h3><i>Sharing and spreading sigillographic knowledge</i></h3>
   <p>As stated above, SigiDoc is using EpiDoc through EFES. This underlies the organisation of the
    information and its appearance, but the digital translation of all the sigillographic criteria
    used in a scholarly edition of a seal is the most original part of SigiDoc. The information
    displayed on the final webpage, easily readable by anyone, comes from all the XML files in a
    corpus - files written according to the XML language; since the beginning of the project, the
    main task has been making choices about how to deploy XML terminology in the edition of seals,
    and how to extract from it the most valuable information, in order to get the best visualisation
    and organisation of the data; SigiDoc offers a set of <a
     href="../Guidelines_XML/xml-html/SigiDoc_allguidelines.html" target="_blank">guidelines</a>
    which have emerged from that work.</p>
   <figure class="page"><a href="SD_page.png" target="_blank"><img src="SD_page.png"
      alt="SigiDoc from seals to webpage" height="276" width="500" /></a><figcaption>1.2. Creation
     of a SigiDoc page.</figcaption></figure>
   <p>Several <b>conventional signs</b> and <b>symbols</b> are in use in order to allow a
     <b>detailed description of the legend</b>: for example, the type of lacuna, of a gap in the
    legend, does it concern characters or whole lines? Are the lines/characters completely lost or
    something is still visible but illegible? Is the extent of this lacuna known, unknown or
    approximately established (in terms of number of lines or number of characters)? And has the
    legend been restored with certainty, tentatively, or by comparison with parallels? And so on...
    Each one of this possibilities involves the use of different conventional signs in the editorial
    interpretation, corresponding to different XML tags.</p>
   <p>The first task of a SigiDoc user is still the <b>scientific analysis of the seals</b>: the
    sigillographic skills are irreplaceable when preparing an edition of unpublished material, and
    strongly recommended when converting a paper edition into a digital one.</p>
   <p>Once a traditional edition is ready, the data should be transferred and stored into the XML
    files: those files are roughly organised in order to group the data of the same nature (see here
    image 1.2), thus facilitating their input in the <a
     href="../Guidelines_XML/template/template.html" target="_blank">SigiDoc template</a>. SigiDoc
    users will be able to make a choice among its many fields, but it is recommended to proceed in a
    collaborative way in order to <b>ensure consistency among different SigiDoc corpora</b>. What is
    striking is that the digital edition pushes editors to precision, accuracy, and consistency
    sometimes even to a higher degree than for paper editions, simply because they have to instruct
    the machine on what to do in very precise and unequivocal terms. The digital editor has at their
    disposal a set of markup recommendations enabling them to encode all the necessary metadata
    (about the seal as an object, its history, etc.), the legend, the apparatus criticus, the
    bibliography, the commentary with the related footnotes; consistency in markup will enable the
    program to populate the indices and support the search process.</p>
   <p>When all the XML files are ready, they may be transferred inside a <b>SigiDoc-customised
     version of EFES</b>, in an appropriate directory: a preview of the webpage is then displayed.
    This is the last step which takes place locally, on the editor's machine: the 'digital
    manuscript' is ready, awaiting publication after finding a host server.</p>
   <p>Anyone will be able to produce new editions when new data appear (e.g., parallels newly
    edited) or some information change (e.g., new dating or reading). Basically, all the data
    contained in the SigiDoc files will be easily updated, not only locally, on a single computer,
    but on the website displaying the edition; it will also be easier to follow the seals sold
    through auctions. As matter of fact, SigiDoc gives the chance to <b>update the information
     without any delay</b>, thus promoting its circulation and its scientific study, making this
    material quickly available to anyone. The condition is ensuring the record of changes by keeping
    track of the different versions of the editions.</p>
